## Lecture Notes
Here are all the notes I wrote in theoretical physics and mathematics.

    This note is based on the Quantum Field Theory course I took during my M1 year at the École Normale Supérieure-PSL, with Professor Amir-Kian Kashani-Poor as the course instructor. I would like to express my gratitude for his excellent teaching! Please note that this note is very incomplete. Although I have added some details, it lacks explanations and contains numerous typos. I will work on completing it in the future. If I ever teach Quantum Field Theory in the future, this will be my course outline!

    This paper studies Lyman-alpha radiative transfer process with given density profiles, generalizing the known solutions (for uniform media) to media of power-law density profile. We also develop gridless Monte-Carlo radiative transfer (GMCRT) method to demonstrate the analytic solutions. Thanks to Aaron! I spent a wonderful summer at MIT in 2019. This is the first paper of my academic career!
