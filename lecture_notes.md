## Lecture Notes
Here are all the notes I wrote in theoretical physics and mathematics.

    This note is based on the Quantum Field Theory course I took during my M1 year at the École Normale Supérieure-PSL (M2-level course), with Professor Amir-Kian Kashani-Poor as the course instructor. I would like to express my gratitude for his excellent teaching! Please note that this note is very incomplete. Although I have added some details, it lacks explanations and contains numerous typos. I will work on completing it in the future. If I ever teach Quantum Field Theory in the future, this will be my course outline!

    This note is based on a library-based project (Projet bibliographique) I completed during my M1 studies at the École Normale Supérieure-PSL (under the guidance of Prof. Jan Troost). In this note, the ADM formalism is extended to arbitrary dimensions, and the properties of conformal flatness are used to derive differential equations, explaining some unique characteristics of three-dimensional gravity.
