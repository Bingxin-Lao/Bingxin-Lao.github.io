email: bxlaophysics@gmail.com
education:
  - years: 2021 - present
    name: Master in Physics
    location:  École Normale Supérieure - PSL (Ulm), Paris, France
    description: Admitted through 2021 <a href="https://www.ens.psl.eu/en/academics/admissions/international-selection">International Selection</a> (Normalien, 1000 euros/month grant for 3 years)
  - years: 2017 - 2021
    name: Bachelor degree of Sciences, Physics
    location: University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China
    description: Outstanding graduate, Ji-Ci Yan's scholarship
Research_Experience: 
  - years: 2023.01 - 2023.06
    name: M2 thesis 
    location: Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques, Paris, France
    supervisor: Slava Rychkov
    description: We apply the conformal perturbation theory to construct the effective Hamiltonian of the transverse field Ising model, numerically demonstrating the state-operator correspondence in a direct way. See Preprint [P2].
  - years: 2022.02 - 2022.08
    name: M1 thesis
    location: Institut de Physique Théorique, Paris, France
    supervisor: Ruben Minasian
    description: Observe that there exists composite anomaly in 8D minimal supergravity (with 16 supercharges), potentially the anomaly cancellation can help us select the possible consistent theory. We explicitly show that relation between this anomaly and the Borcherds product and point out that the symmetry enhancements are actually accompanied with reflective lattices. See Preprint [P1].
  - years: 2020.03 - 2021.07
    name: Undergraduate research and Bachelor thesis
    location: Fudan University, Shanghai, China
    supervisor: Ling-Yan Hung
    description: We investigate the Levin-Wen model where we drop the unitary requirement. By studying a concrete example (Galois conjugates of string-net model), we explain how to extract the modular data and entanglement entropy by using tensor network. See Publication [2].
  - years: 2019.7 - 2019.9
    name: Summer research
    location: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, USA
    supervisor: Mark Vogelsberger and Aaron Smith
    description: We analytically study the Lyman-alpha radiative process within power-density profile and apply Gridless Monte-Carlo Radiative Transfer (GMCRT) method to numerically demonstrate our new solutions. See Publication [1].
