[1] Bing-Xin Lao, Aaron Smith, Resonant-line radiative transfer within power-law density profiles, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Volume 497, Issue 3, September 2020, Pages 3925â€“3942, https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/staa2198 
Abstract: This paper studies Lyman-alpha radiative transfer process with given density profiles, generalizing the known solutions to non uniform media. Develop gridless Monte-Carlo radiative transfer (GMCRT) method to verify the analytic solutions.
