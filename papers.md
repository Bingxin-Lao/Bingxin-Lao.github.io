    This article generalizes the Levin-Wen model to the non-unitary case (where the constructed Hamiltonian is no longer Hermitian). Utilizing tensor network techniques, we describe how to compute the modular data ($S,T$ matrix) and topological entanglement entropy for this scenario. Although we primarily use Galois conjugates to construct non-Hermitian models, the formalism in the article can be extended to other non-Hermitian cases. This article was completed during my junior and senior years and represents a significant result in my graduation thesis. I spent a wonderful senior year at Fudan University, during which I also visited Professor Liang Kong's research group at the Southern University of Science and Technology for one month. I would like to express my gratitude to Professor Hung for her support and assistance! Professor Hung is truly an exceptionally accomplished theoretical physicist. Her passion for theoretical physics has deeply influenced me.

    This paper studies Lyman-alpha radiative transfer process with given density profiles, generalizing the known solutions (for uniform media) to media of power-law density profile. We also develop gridless Monte-Carlo radiative transfer (GMCRT) method to demonstrate the analytic solutions. Thanks to Aaron! I spent a wonderful summer at MIT in 2019. This is the first paper of my academic career!

    This was the topic of my internship during the first year of my master's program, and I really enjoyed this article. While contemplating this article, it was the first time I realized on my own that the gauge anomaly problem is related to modular forms on the orthogonal group (even though I later found out that many theoretical physicists had already realized this...). By introducing Borcherds products, we were able to pinpoint the Swampland for eight-dimensional $\mathcal{N} = 1$ supergravity. It's evident that physics and mathematics are intricately interconnected, and once again, string theory and mathematics have revealed their profound beauty. From February to August 2022, I had a wonderful time at IPhT, and I'm grateful to Ruben for that!

    This was the topic of my internship during the second year of my master's program, under the guidance of Professor Slava Rychkov. During the course of the project, I gained a deep understanding of higher-dimensional conformal field theory. IHES is a truly beautiful place, with many highly accomplished researchers in both theoretical physics and mathematics. I'm grateful to Slava for his guidance!
